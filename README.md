The original intent of this project was to update my previously cookie-cutter portfolio for something more styled and true to my personality. I figued that if folks wanted to see my work, I should make sure that the material was presented how I wanted. 

I started designing my portfolio in January of 2021 and ran through about half a dozen designs before I settled on a space theme with emphasis on animation and fluid graphics. I spent a few weeks learning how to program with GSAP and learned about a few animation libraries. In March, I began developing the portfolio and ran into a few snags along the way. 

The biggest problem I was contending with was programming my CSS using relative units and media queries. Considering that CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Material UI existed, I wondered if hard coding my CSS was worth the effort. But I reasoned that using my own CSS would be a good way to reinforce the fundamentals of my learning. 

Looking back at this project, I see the potential for improvement. Most notably, this project would have benefitted from React's component organization system. I see now that many of the buttons and title stylings are similar and could have been made into components. I think moving forward I will refactor my code to follow the React framework. 

In the end, I am happy with how my portfolio looks and I think it displays my work in an intuitive and highly styled way.
