The original intent of this project was to update my previously cookie-cutter portfolio for something more styled and true to my personality. I figued that if folks wanted to see my work, I should make sure that the material was presented how I wanted.

The first version of this website ran on a basic HTML, CSS, and light JS but ultimately felt bloated and inefficient. Though the scope of this portfolio is small, I felt like converting this project into the React framework would benefit in the long run. One, it demonstrates my ability to work with React functional components, and two, the addition of Sass and even more JS adds a level of fluidity not present in the first design.
