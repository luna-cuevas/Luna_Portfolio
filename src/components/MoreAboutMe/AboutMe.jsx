            <p>I am a hard working and talented non-binary individual. As an immigrant from Mexico and a former foster youth, I've had to overcome many barriers and challenges in my life. Knowing that my future was ultimately left to me and the opportunities I created for myself, I used my intellect to obtain a scholarship from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to attend UC Berkeley. I graduated with a degree in History and Political Science in 2016. I've worked as a customer service manager, warehouse manager, and freelance graphic designer since then.</p>

            <p>My intellectual curiosity has led me to learn a lot of skills over the years. I've learned how to play the guitar, organize marches, train teams, graphic design, music production, and now I'm teaching myself how to code. The impetus for a lot of these skills is based on my passion for aesthetics, music, and politics.</p>

            <p>My experiences learning graphic design gave me the self-confidence to pick up a skill I had wanted to pursue since my youth. Learning to code has allowed me to push the envelope and make websites look the way I want them. In my experience, website builders are very useful but limited my creative scope. So I felt compelled to pick up a few books, purchase tutorials, and spend a year learning how to code. I'm proud of how far I've come and I'm confident in my ability to help create art, websites, and music people need.</p>
