                        <p>Hello! Thanks for taking a moment to check out my website!</p>
                        <p>I'm an aspiring full-stack developer working on their second year of self-teaching web development. I use Udemy courses, bootcamp material, Youtube tutorials, and <i>plenty</i> of books to reinforce the fundamentals of web development. I've also gained a community of developers through online forums and discord servers. </p>
                        <p>The reason I embarked on this journey was because I found myself at a crossroads in my life. After graduating from U.C. Berkeley with a degree in Political Science, and working with startups in a variety of roles for 4 years, I realized that I needed the sense of fulfillment that comes with a career. I wanted my work to have a meaningful impact. And as someone obsessed with technology and its socio-political impact, I decided to learn to code. </p>
                        <p>This portfolio exists as an example of my design and development skills. The goal is to find a team of talented engineers to take a chance and allow me to demonstrate my capabilities to design and develop great features, applications, and user experiences. Regardless of your position, I would really appreciate any feedback, comments, or mentorship you wish to give.</p>
                        <p>Thanks again for taking time to read through this, you're awesome!</p>
